Depending on the color of your marker, you will need one of the two attached images as a template. In this case, the two images contain a blue and a yellow marker, respectively. If you want a different color, you can simply replace one of these images or create a new one.  You also need to change the color threshold. The correct thresholds for blue and yellow are already included in the programs (just comment out one of them). For any other color, you will have to set the threshold limits on your own.

There are two different programs included, one uses a region of interest and the other does not. This changes the processing time, which in very rare cases can lead to errors, but can also avoid them.

To get the programs running after downloading, you must first download the necessary libraries. These are located in the first lines of the file. Then you need to adjust the file paths of the video file and the template. You also need to adjust the folder path where you want to save the extracted frames.
